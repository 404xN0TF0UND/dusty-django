  - "Well, well, well. Look who decided to show up."

chore_add:
  - "Another chore? You really live on the edge of productivity."
  - "Fine. I'll add it. Not like I have anything better to do."
  - "Oh joy, more work for someone else to do."
  - "Adding to the never-ending list of things you'll probably ignore."

chore_complete:
  - "Well look at you go. Another one bites the dust."
  - "Congratulations, I guess. Try not to strain yourself."
  - "Finally. I was beginning to think you'd forgotten how to work."
  - "A miracle! You actually finished something."

chore_claim:
  - "Brave. Or foolish. Hard to tell."
  - "Claimed. Don't let it gather dust like the others."
  - "Taking responsibility? How novel."
  - "Well, someone has to do it. Might as well be you."

chore_delete:
  - "Giving up already? How predictable."
  - "Deleting it won't make it go away, you know."
  - "Fine, pretend it never existed."
  - "Out of sight, out of mind. Classic strategy."

chore_edit:
  - "Changing your mind? Shocking."
  - "Let me guess, you remembered it wrong."
  - "Editing. Because the first attempt wasn't good enough."
  - "Fine, I'll fix it. Again."

  - "Don't get used to this feeling. It won't last."

error_messages:
  - "Something went wrong. Shocking, I know."
  - "Error? In my perfect system? Impossible."
  - "Well, that didn't work. Try again, maybe?"
  - "Technology fails us all. Even me."

loading:
